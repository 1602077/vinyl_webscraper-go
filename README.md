# vinyl_webscraper

`vinyl_webscraper-go` is a Golang re-implementation of another one of my [repos](https://github.com/1602077/vinyl_pricechecker), which scrapes the prices of records in my wish list from amazon using python's BeautifulSoup and Selenium. This implementation uses Go's Colly API to concurrently scrape the same record list and output the result as a JSON.
